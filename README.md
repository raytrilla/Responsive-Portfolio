# Challenge 2: Responsive Portfolio

A build of a responsive portfolio that showcases my skills and talents, specifically in HTML and CSS. 

This portfolio is designed following the following criteria:

When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
- See attached image showing my name, profile picture and links to about, work and contact sections.

When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- See attached video showing the UI scrolling to the prompted section.

When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
- Image shows that all projects(images) in the work section are all titled.

When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- Image shows that first application appears larger than the others.

When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
- As i currently don't have any deployed applications I've added in placeholder images.

When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport
- See attached video video showing the website's responsiveness
